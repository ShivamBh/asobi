- Find and use local aws credentials 
  - If multiple profiles are found, parse them ask which one to use
   - Or export in the env and asobi will use that
   - If not found, prompt user to input 
- asobi init: Make a local yaml config file inside .asobi folder
- Record everything there 
- When something fails, retry based on yaml file

- asobi create does a init in the background if not already present.
 - If present, tell the user theres already an application and show the details. Prompt user to use other commands because create is already done.
 - Maybe detect app status in this stage if there is a failed deployment

 - If user wants to make another, allow

- asobi ls, asobi delete, asobi deploy etc. all rely on the local config yaml to do stuff.

- asobi delete: Remove all the stuff in a particular order.
 - Does not reset the config file. User can use the same stuff again to create another deployment from scratch

- Use the resourcegrouptagging API to find applications created by asobi
